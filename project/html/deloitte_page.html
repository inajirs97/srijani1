 <p> Nagpur:

Uddhav Thackeray, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, has said it was his party Shiv Sena's "mistake" to mix religion with politics and stay with the BJP. It is a significant admission from the firebrand Sena chief, who is known for his pro-Hindutva politics and has made no bones about his views on subjects like the temple-mosque dispute in Ayodhya.

This statement was made in the Maharashtra assembly last week, weeks after he took on an administrative role for the first time in his political career. He was responding to his predecessor and former ally Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP, who had taunted him on turning his back on his party's ideology to tie up with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

Reminding the BJP of its own alliances with parties of opposite ideologies like Mamata Banerjee, Ram Vilas Paswan and even the PDP, Uddhav Thackeray said by mixing religion and politics and staying with the BJP was a mistake.</p>
